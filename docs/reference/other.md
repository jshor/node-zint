## Flattermarken

![Flattermarken](/assets/barcodes/barcode_53.png)

Used for the recognition of page sequences in print-shops, the Flattermarken is not a true barcode symbol and requires precise knowledge of the position of the mark on the page. The Flattermarken system can encode any length numeric data and does not include a check digit.

## DAFT Code

This is a method for creating 4-state codes where the data encoding is provided by an external program. Input data should consist of the letters `D`, `A`, `F`, and `T`, where these refer to **descender**, **ascender**, **full** (ascender and descender) or **tracker** (neither ascender nor descender) respectively.

:::tip Note
Any characters other than `D`, `A`, `F`, or `T` are ignored.
